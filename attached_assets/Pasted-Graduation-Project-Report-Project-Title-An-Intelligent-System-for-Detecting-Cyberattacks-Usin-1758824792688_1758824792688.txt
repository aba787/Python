Project Title

"An Intelligent System for Detecting Cyberattacks Using Artificial Intelligence"

Introduction

These days, networks have become a part of our daily lives, and businesses have become completely dependent on them. With this, there are significant threats from cyberattacks, whether data theft, service disruption, or system hacking. Traditional attack detection systems rely on fixed rules, meaning that if an attack is new or different, it is often detected.

That's why I decided to develop a project based on artificial intelligence to analyze network traffic and detect attacks intelligently and proactively, with an interface that displays all alerts and statistics in real-time and is easy to use.

Project Objectives

1. Design a system that can monitor network traffic in real time.
2. Use artificial intelligence to identify any abnormal activity and distinguish it from normal activity.
3. Reduce errors that occur in traditional systems (false positives and false negatives).
4. Create a dashboard that displays the types, number, and source of attacks.
5. Raising the level of cybersecurity using modern and intelligent technologies.

Protocols We Will Focus On

• TCP/IP: The foundation of network data transmission.
• HTTP/HTTPS: To detect web attacks such as SQL Injection and XSS.
• DNS: To detect DNS spoofing or tunneling attacks.
• SMTP/IMAP/POP3: To monitor email attacks such as phishing and malware.
• SNMP: To monitor devices and detect any suspicious activity on the network.

Data Analysis Method

1. Data Collection:
• We capture network packets using tools such as Wireshark or Python libraries such as Scapy.
• We can also use ready-made data such as NSL-KDD or CICIDS2017 to train the system.

2. Preprocessing:

• Data cleaning and noise removal.
• Extracting important features such as the number of packets, protocols, ports, and session duration.

3. AI Training Phase:

• We use machine learning models such as Random Forest and SVM.
• Or deep learning models such as LSTM and CNN.
• The model classifies traffic as normal or attack.

4. Operation and Detection Phase:

• The system monitors the network live.
• If it detects any suspicious traffic, it immediately classifies it.
• It sends an alert to the user interface with details of the attack.

Linking the System to AI

• All the data we capture is fed into the AI ​​module.
• The trained model classifies it as normal or attack.
• The results are displayed directly on the dashboard, as an email alert, or as a notification.

User Interface (Dashboard)

• An interactive dashboard with:
• Live network traffic statistics.
• Number and types of detected attacks.
• A map or graph of attack sources.
• Alert logs with the attacker's IP address, attack type, and time.
• We can build it as:
• A web application using Flask/Django + React
• A desktop application using PyQt or Tkinter

Tools and Technologies

• Programming Language: Python
• Artificial Intelligence Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
• Data Analysis Libraries: Pandas, Numpy
• Data Plotting and Analysis Libraries: Matplotlib, Plotly
• Network Analysis Tools: Wireshark, Scapy

Expected Outputs
• An intelligent system capable of accurately detecting all types of network attacks.
• An interactive dashboard displays alerts and statistics in real-time.
• Reduces breaches through early attack prediction

Introduction (Brief)

With the increasing reliance on networks and information systems, cyberattacks have become a direct threat to organizations, while traditional detection systems are limited in their ability to counter sophisticated attacks. This project aims to develop a smart system based on artificial intelligence techniques to analyze network traffic and proactively detect attacks, while providing an interactive interface for real-time alerts and statistics.

We create a website
We download Visual + Redhat
We conduct a Redhat attack on Windows
And ensure the system can intercept it.
